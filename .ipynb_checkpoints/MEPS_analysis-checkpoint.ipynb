    "\n",
    "Some obvious things to keep in mind from looking at them -  \n",
    "1) a significant proportion of subjects are younger than sixteen. For these individuals, we have basically zero info - best to drop them from our tables and not make predictions for them. A cursory search of meds reveals no medication info for them.  \n",
    "2) We have tons of duplicate meds - we'll probably want to consolidate these. \n",

    "Since this is an informal ad hoc analysis, I'll just be checking results of operations rather than building out proper tests. Of course, this isn't intended to look like production code :)"

    "#### 3) Let's model one disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "First we have to pick a disease. If I want to pick one that's easy to model, it would be nice to choose one that has lots of instances and that is also well-distinguished by a small number of criteria. As you can see below, HBP would be an obvious choice, but HBP is really common, even in people who are mostly healthy. It would be cool to train a more complex model on it, but for the sake of simplicity, I'll model diabetes, which is a classic stats/ML problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "By the way, with regards to model performance, we probably care more about recall than precision in this instance - we really want to pick up cases of the disease based on medicines and don't care all that much if we falsely flag the potential presence of a disease. Also, raw accuracy isn't far off from worthless, since (most) of these disease are pretty rare. Diabetes affects around 10% of people in a random sample of Americans, so a model that predicts y=0 is 90% accurate in a random samples (and 74% accurate in our sample - our sample isn't a random sample of Americans, as we'll soon find out)."
